## Design a Conversational Chatbot

You can find an architecture diagram of the Chatbot below:


### Introduction
- Any user interacts with the Chatbot by sending a message through the Chat Interface (UI). The Chat interface then passes this message to an intelligent system that processes the message and generates a response. The response is then sent back to the Chat Interface, which displays the response to the user.

- Inside the intelligent system, there are multiple components that work together to generate the response. The first component is the Conversation Stage Classifier, which classifies the message into one of the conversation stages. The conversation stages are the different stages of the conversation, such as an introduction, a mood-check, a reflection, an exercise, and a wrap-up, etc. The Conversation Stage Classifier uses a Machine/Deep Learning model to classify the message into one of the conversation stages.

- The next component is the Language Model, which generates the response based on the conversation stage. The Language Model is a Deep Learning model that is trained on a large corpus of text data to generate human-like responses. The Language Model takes the conversation stage and the message as input and generates the response as output. While generating the response, the Language Model can also use the context aka memory from the previous messages to generate a more coherent response. Each of the stage has its own Agent (Language Model) to generate the response. 


### Memory Management
As we know Large Language Models are stateless and do not have memory. So, we need to store the history in order to make more coherent responses. There are multiple ways to store the history. Some of them are:

- BufferMemory: We can store the history in a buffer memory. The buffer memory can store the messages in the conversation. The Language Model can then query this buffer memory to get the context and generate the response. The problem is it can only store a limited number of messages and the context is lost after the buffer is full.

- BufferMemory with Fixed Size: We can store the history in a buffer memory with a fixed size. The buffer memory can store the most recent `n` messages in the conversation. The problem is it can only store a limited number of messages and the context is lost after the buffer is full.

- SummaryMemory: We can store the history in a summary memory. The summary memory can store the summary of the conversation. The problem is it while creating the summary, some context is lost. Another possibility is storing the summary of only last `n` messages.

- Vector Database: Here, we can store everything in a database like PostGreSQL, and others etc. It is the most stable and long term storage way to store the history. It can also help to store contexts across sessions. The top `n` relevant context can be retrieved from the database and passed to the Language Model to generate the response. 


### Learning from Feedback to improve the Chatbot

- Collect Feedback: After each interaction, provide users with the option to rate the chatbot's response as good or bad, or on a numerical scale. This can be done directly within the chat interface. You might also consider allowing users to leave comments for more detailed feedback. We will be logging the (query, response, feedback) in a database or with other tools like LangSmith that store each and every interaction with the LLM. 

- Train with Feedback: Use the feedback data to train and fine-tune your agent aka LLM. One leverage techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) to train the LLM. The model is rewarded for responses that received good ratings and penalized for those that received poor ratings. Over time, this helps the chatbot to "learn" to give more responses that are similar to those rated well, and fewer responses similar to those rated poorly. 

- Iterate and Improve: Continuously iterate on this process. The more feedback data you collect and incorporate into your training process, the better your chatbot will perform.
